   axios.get(newsApi).then(response => {
      console.log(response.data.articles)
      this.setState({
         news:response.data.articles
      })
   }).catch( err => console.log(err))
}
``` 


## Backend

         author: req.body.author,
         url: req.body.url,
         userId: req.body.userId
      }, (err,article) => {
         User.findById(req.body.userId, (err, user) => {
            user.articles.push(article);
            user.save((err, user) => {
               res.status(201).json(user);

## Data Visualization 
   - Previously we had experience with React-vis, however; this time we decided to use another program called Recharts. Recharts make it easy to intergrate charts into your React application. For more information on Recharts check out www.recharts.org
